We get tokens for everytime we want to use the website as a user. Tokens expire after a while or when you log out mannually.
You get tokens produced by the server when you pass in valid credentials like email and password.
Then that token gets attached to the user's request calls automatically for every protected route he wants to access like profile and posts.
Tokens are valid for a while (depending on time limit you set for them) or until you manually log out.
